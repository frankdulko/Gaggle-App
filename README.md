# Gaggle
WEEK 7:

Continued optimizing UI.

Created a popover menu.

Furthered understanding of "Published" and "Observed" variables and how they work.
(.onAppear is not reloaded when an observed variable changes)
Fixed issue with location updating.

Optimized the map and the map view. Took out all unnecessary functionality. Took out all user interaction with map. Added annotations with custom marker.

Added snapshot listener to firestore database which ended up working and integrating seamlessly. Actually was surprised by this.

Finally think I have profile pictures working on all views. (Not entierly sure if it is optimized for reads).
Took several attempts to manage aceessing the data outside of closure.

Need to update security rules for Firestore.

 
WEEK 6:
Streamlined UI

Added ability to upload a profile picture.
